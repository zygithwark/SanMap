# SanMap

Open-source sanitation mapping tool for community data collection

## Overview

SanMap is a mobile application designed to address the critical gap in sanitation data collection in developing regions. The lack of actionable, up-to-date data on sanitation infrastructure hinders effective planning, maintenance, and investment in sanitation services. SanMap empowers community members, field workers, NGOs, and local governments to map the location, type, and condition of sanitation facilities in a given region.

## Purpose

The core problem we solve is the absence of reliable, geospatial data about sanitation facilities. Without this data, it is difficult to:
- Identify areas with inadequate sanitation coverage
- Prioritize maintenance and repair efforts
- Plan new infrastructure investments
- Monitor progress towards sanitation goals (e.g., SDG 6)

SanMap provides a simple, intuitive mobile interface that allows users to record GPS coordinates, facility type, operational status, and upload photos—even in areas with limited or no internet connectivity.

## Target Users

- **Community Health Workers** – Collect data during routine visits
- **NGOs & Non-profits** – Monitor sanitation projects and impact
- **Local Government Officials** – Plan and manage sanitation services
- **Researchers & Academics** – Study sanitation access and quality
- **Community Members** – Report broken or missing facilities

## Core Features (Planned)

- **Offline-first data collection** – Work without continuous internet
- **GPS‑based mapping** – Pinpoint exact facility locations
- **Customizable survey forms** – Adapt to local needs
- **Photo upload** – Visual documentation of conditions
- **User authentication** – Secure login for field teams
- **Data export** – Generate reports and share with stakeholders
